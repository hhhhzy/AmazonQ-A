It's not tethered to a base that transmits audio like wireless systems require you to. I traded the convenience for worrywart health precaution and audio quality, but I'm glad I did.Finally, I'll give you a really nice pointer that helped me tremendously. I know that after it is repaired this last time. It will break again within 2 months. The build quality is awful on this headset. It feels solid, but it's constantly breaking. I would never recommend anyone purchase this product. I realize this issue is obviously on Sony's head, not Astro. Still very irksome.EDIT 2: After more experimenting I found that the sound delay issue only exists when using the 360. Everything else is perfectly synced when using the TV's optical out. They have four different EQs and it matches pretty much all games. I play Gears of War 3 for the most part, so I keep it on the main EQ.
