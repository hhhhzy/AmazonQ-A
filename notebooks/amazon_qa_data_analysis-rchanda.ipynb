But it's still plastic so depending on how strong he is, he might break it.  You'll also need to keep the magnetic key away from him as he'll see you using it and likely learn.  My 3 year old tries but he doesn't know the exact spot to put the key to unlock the door.  Overall after trying several locks for cabinet doors this was the best in my opinion.
